# Scripts for sending emails using Python

## Content (content.html)
For each email, we only need to replace `[Name]` in the content with the main recipient's name. The script will automatically replace it with the correct name.

## Main Program (main.py)

Please replace the following variables with your own values:
- `sender_email`: The email address of the sender.
- `sender_password`: The password of the sender's email account.
- `sen2url`: the receiver's email addresses.
- `names`: the names of the recipients.
- `attaches`: the attachments of the emails.
