Dear Professor [Name],

    <p>
        I hope this email finds you well.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am a master student currently studying in Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences. Before entering graduate school, I got a bachelor degree in Electronic Engineering in Nankai University. My research interest involves formal verification and software engineering, especially in the field of SAT/SMT Solvers. I am writing to inquire about the possibility of joining your group for a summer research internship.
    </p>

    <p>
        My research experiences mainly focus on Satisfiabily Modulo Nonlinear Arithmetc (SMT_NRA). I participated the SMT-COMP 2022 & 2023 as a co-designer of <a href='https://z3-plus-plus.github.io/'>Z3-Plus-Plus</a>, which wins several gold medals in FLoC. Nonlinear arithmetic solving in Z3++ involves heuristic for variable order, feasible set checking and hybrid strategy of DPLL(T) and Nlsat.

        Besides, I have a strong background in incomplete algorithms, Local Search for example. I have implemented a local search algorithm for SMT_NRA, which is able to solve more instances than many state-of-the-art solvers. The novel algorithm implements a new strategy to handle nonlinear constraints and equality relaxations, which is already printed in VMCAI'2024. You can check details at this link <a href='https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/978-3-031-50524-9_15'> Efficient Local Search for Nonlinear Real Arithmetic</a>. My presentation video in VMCAI'2024 London is available at <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKGDRTXvKjk'>LS_NRA_Presentation</a>. Code is available at my github repository <a href='https://github.com/yogurt-shadow/LS_NRA'>LS_NRA</a>.

        Recently I have also gained some progress in complete algorithms (MCSAT). I introduce the clause-level information to avoid improper literal caused conflicts and facilitate the solver by better branching heuristic. Details can be checked in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02122">clauseSMT_arXiv</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        In the future, I am interested in exploring heuristic algorithms in automated reasoning and formal method like before. Therefore, I am looking forward to joining your group.

        My CV, research statement, transcripts and published papers are attached. Looking forward to your reply.
